## Super-Click

<h1>How it works</h1>

-The application renders different super hero images to the screen. Each image listen for click events.


-The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time.


- The user's score reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.


-Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.


-Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restart.
